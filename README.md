## What is this?

[MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/) is a free lightweight GPU-based voxel art editor and interactive path tracing renderer.<br />
It's also the only 3d modeling software I really enjoy working with.<br />
Yet, There are barely any object libraries for it except for the ones on [the resources page](https://ephtracy.github.io/index.html?page=mv_resource).<br />
Which I intend to change by modeling an asset as often as I can. <br />

## Are the resources free?

yes they are.

## Can you use them any way you want?

Sure, Have fun.

## Can I contribute with my own assets?

If they follow an artistic style similar to my personal assets, Sure why not.<br />
Even so, If your assets are well-built, I can add them as well.<br />

## Can I contribute with something other than 3D objects?

Yeah, Shaders and Palettes are fine as well.<br />
The repository is new, and it needs a lot of assets to become a hub for new MagicaVoxel users.<br />

## Why are you making free assets?

- I'd like to contribute to a community with my skills.<br />
- I'd like to see people create wonderfull things.<br />
- I'd like to have something to do when I'm tired of my other projects. (*Working with this software is fun and keeps my sanity well*)<br />

## Contact?

gmail: saadabou.study@gmail.com;<br />
Website: [morphine Lollipop](https://ssenseii.github.io/MorphineLollipop/) (*it's still in developement + I'm building another soon*)<br />

## Can I make request?

I'll make a website soon for the assets, There you'll be able to put in your requests and search for the assets by name or tag.

### Info About the Object models

- ratio: 40 x 40 x 40<br />
- Some are scaled appropriately (*ex: chalkboard is at 80 x 40 x 50*)
- Editable using the magicavoxel software.<br />
- You can scale them by selecting the entire model and using the scale option in the right menu. (*I'll add a tutorial someday*)<br />
- .vox file format<br />
- can be used with threejs. <br />
